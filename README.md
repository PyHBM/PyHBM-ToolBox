# PyHBM-ToolBox
A Python Implementation of a Robust Multi-harmonic Balance with Numerical Continuation and Automatic Differentiation for Structural Dynamics

The code is available to interested researchers.
The code is not for commercial use.

    PyHBM is a program that uses the Multi-harmonic Balance Method for Periodic Steady-state
    Nonlinear Structural Dynamics. It also performs numerical continuation to build the frequency response.
